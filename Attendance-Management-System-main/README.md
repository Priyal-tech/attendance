# Attendance-Management-System

add-attendance and get-attendance files use lambda to implement the required AWS services

main-attendance is the actual program to see all the student's attendance using the AI at every hour

index.html and main.js are used to make the UI look better to the user by "showing" what happens rather than just "reading" the code

The C++ files are a small attempt to write functiona code as a backup in case the main code cannot get deployed due to the nature of it so that verifiable output is present
